<@fill><q>
R : Kernel with CAF LA.UM.9.2.r1-XXXXX-SDMxx0.0.

XR : Kernel for Android 10 , 11 , and Stock ROM
     which it's still using Old QPNP Vibration driver .
	 With CAF LA.UM.8.2.r2-XXXXX-sdm660.0 , so Don't flash
	 on ROMs with LEDs Based Vibration else Vibrate will Dead.

P : Kernel for Android 9 Custom ROM only with
    CAF LA.UM.9.2.r1-XXXXX-SDMxx0.0 , don't
	flash on others else WiFi Will dead.

NFI : Kernel Variant with CAF 9.2 / R WiFi Driver .
      Recommended to use this variant if u're on Q Firmware.

OFI : Kernel Variant with CAF 7.2 / P WiFi Driver .
      U can use this Variant on Both Firmware (Pie and Q).

LV : For ROM which using LEDs Based Vibration driver or
     usually A11 and above , don't flash on A10 or ROMs
	 which still using Old QPNP Vibration driver else
	 will bootloop.

NLV : For ROMs which still using Old QPNP Vibration Driver
      or usually A10 and below . Don't flash on ROMs with
	  LEDs Based Vibration else Vibrate will Dead.
	  
What is EAS?

Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) is an enhancement
to Linux power management, unifying CPU power
control under the Linux kernel. EAS extends the
Linux kernel scheduler to make it fully aware
of the power/performance capabilities of the
CPUs in the system, to optimize energy
consumption for advanced multi-core SoCs
including big.LITTLE. With EAS, the Linux kernel
will use the task load and a CPU ‘Energy Model’ to
control task placement to select the optimal
CPU to run on.

What is HMP ?

Heterogeneous Multi-Processing (HMP) This is the
standard load scheduler for any big.LITTLE device
released in recent years, other than the
Google Pixel. HMP makes use of the big.LITTLE
architecture, delegating low priority, less intensive
work to the little cores which consume less power.
HMP is “safe” wherein it knows what should go to the
big cores and what should go to the little cores,
without making mistakes. It just works and requires a
lot less effort to set up on the development side than
something like EAS, which we’ll get into in a moment.
HMP is just an extension of CFS to make it power aware.

HMP doesn’t take guesses, nor does it predict future
processes. This is good but is why the device cannot be
as fluid as those running EAS and is also why it consumes
slightly more battery. This, finally, brings us to
Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS), which I firmly believe is
the future in ROM and kernel development as more OEMs
adopt it.
